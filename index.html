          <p class="text-home">
          I started programming at the age of 10 with a computer with MS-DOS. My first program was an animation with Qbasic, an animation of Dragon Ball Z (it was just a circle moving from left to right). I remember having a lot of fun with my little brother at that time. When I grew up I always had an excuse to not learn, it was too difficult or right now I don't have time. I always was taking courses in Coursera about Java or Python but never finished it. At the age of 29 after I worked in IT and also was part of an entrepreneurship I took the decision to be a software developer. 
          </p>
          <p class="text-home">
From there I study on FreeCodeCamp and other resources to develop my skills. I enjoy the infinites possibilities of software development. You can create a giant app or a small app for yourself. 
          </p>
          <p class="text-home">
I am planning to learn about machine learning and security in future, just for curiosity.
